# Light Tunnel

Light tunnel is an interactive media piece, where users modify a display of three circles using a combination of joysticks buttons and switches. The sensor data is received and processed by the ESP32 board which then writes the information to the PI.
The PI then generates a visual and aural display projected from beneath. 

The code for the ESP32 board can be found in the arduino folder and the processing sketch in the processing folder.

To get the code running upload the arduino sketch to the ESP32 board, import the `processing-sound` library, and run the processing sketch.
